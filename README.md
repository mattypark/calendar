- A Google Cloud Project with Calendar API enabled
- Google OAuth 2.0 credentials

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd calendar
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Google OAuth:**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google Calendar API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
     - Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
     - Set application type to "Web application"
     - Add authorized redirect URIs:
       - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback` (for development)
       - `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/google/callback` (for production)

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` and add your Google OAuth credentials:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_here
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
   ```

5. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How It Works

### Event Sources

The application automatically fetches events from multiple South Oldham High School sources:

1. **District Calendar** (`oldham.kyschools.us/view-all-events`)
   - District-wide events and holidays
   - Administrative announcements
   - School closure dates

2. **School Website** (`sohs.oldham.kyschools.us`)
   - School-specific academic events
   - Extracurricular activities
   - Parent-teacher conferences

3. **Athletics Website**
   - Sports schedules and games
   - Athletic events and tournaments
   - Team activities

### Event Categories

Events are automatically categorized for easy filtering:

- **Academic**: Classes, exams, academic events
- **Athletic**: Sports games, tournaments, athletic activities
- **Extracurricular**: Clubs, dances, non-academic activities
- **Administrative**: Holidays, closures, district announcements

### Sync Process

1. **Connect Google Calendar**: Authenticate with your Google account
2. **Browse Events**: View all upcoming school events with filtering options
3. **Select Events**: Choose which events you want to sync
4. **Sync to Calendar**: Events are automatically added to your Google Calendar with proper categorization and details
